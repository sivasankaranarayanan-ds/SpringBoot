Define Docker?
    Using Docker with Spring Boot is a common practice to containerize your applications,
    making them portable, scalable, and easier to deploy.
    Docker containers provide an isolated environment for running applications,
    along with their dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

Create Docker File:
    This file contains instructions for building a Docker image for your application.

Build Docker Image:
    Open a terminal in the directory containing your Dockerfile and
    run the following command to build a Docker image: docker build -t your-image-name .

Run Docker Container:
    Once the Docker image is built,
    you can run a Docker container using the following command: docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
    This command maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine.
    Replace your-image-name with the name of your Docker image.

Access Your Application:
    Your Spring Boot application should now be running inside a Docker container. You can access it
    by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser or by sending HTTP requests to port 8080.
