Naming Convention:

Variable convention:
    Variable Name Convention start with small letter
    It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
    If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed
    by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName.
    Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.

Class convention:
    Class Name Should start with Capital Letter

Package convention:
    package name should start with small letter
    If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util, java.lang.

Interface convention:
    Interface names should be capitalized like class names.
    
Method convention:
    It should start with lowercase letter.
    It should be a verb such as main(), print().

RestURL convention:
    URIs should be named with nouns that specify the contents of the resource, rather than adding a verb for the function that is being performed.
    The forward-slash (/) character is used in the path portion of the URI to indicate a hierarchical relationship between resources.
    Should use lowercase letters in API URLs because URIs are case-sensitive. 
    Lowercase letters for URIs are in widespread use, and also help avoid confusion about inconsistent capitalization.
    Avoid file extensions.
    Avoid special characters.
    Separate words with underscores.
    Eg: https://api.example.com/users/123/first_name
